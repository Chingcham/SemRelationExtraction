# SemRelationExtraction

A simple model to learn relation embedding between words using an unlabelled corpora(ukWaC) and evaluate them with 3 labelled datasets (BLESS, EVALuation1.0, EACL dataset for antonym and synonym distinction)

## Steps: ##


        * Preprocess the Corpus [Go to /Preprocess]
        * Run the Model [Go  to /Model]
        * Perform the Evaluation [Go to /Evaluation]

        * For additional experiments [Go to /Extras]
