# Model


This module is to generate relation embedding.

## Steps

* Initially, the relation embedding between nouns in the copora is generated
* Later, these embeddings are genralized for any two words relation embedding using a mapping matrix


### Skip-gram

* Skip-gram for triples is trained using negative sampling method.
* Pair embedding for every frequent noun pair is generated by predicting in-between words of the pair
* Go to [./SkipGram]

### Mapping-matrix

* The noun pair embeddings are used to train a mapping matrix.
* This mapping matrix is later utilized to generate relation embedding for every pair in evaluation dataset.
* Go to [./MappingMatrix]
